CodeSoda.Scheduler is a simple Task Scheduler in C# that enables any WinForms or ASP.NET /MVC project to run scheduled tasks in the background.
It understands running a task AT a certain time, EVERY x time or can also host self managed tasks.

CodeSoda.Scheduler does not interact with the system scheduled tasks in anyway and runs using threads within the hosted process.
